Deciphon is a robust protein annotation software tailored for handling long-read
sequencing data with high error rates. By leveraging a novel approach that
incorporates quasi-codons, Deciphon allows for direct annotation of protein sequences
without the need for prior error correction or open reading frame identification.

The figure above illustrates the Pfam annotations found using Deciphon, compared to combinations
of Prodigal and FragGeneScan with HMMER, on a long-read of the Chlamydia strain 14-2711_R47,
isolated from flamingos.
The alignment spans a chromosomal region of 23,953 nucleotides and consists of 23,242 matches,
880 deletions, and 711 insertions. Deciphon recovered 21 out of 29 proteins (72%) while
mislabelling only one (Chordopox_A30L). FGS1-HMMER and FGS3-HMMER recovered 10 (34%) and
8 (28%) proteins, respectively. Prodigal-HMMER predicted 9 genes but found no significant
match against Pfam.

## Quick start

To get started, you can install Deciphon via the command line using Python‚Äôs package manager:

```sh
pip install deciphon
```

Deciphon is compatible with both __macOS__ and __Linux__ operating systems.
Once installed, you can access the help documentation by entering:

```sh
deciphon --help
```

in the terminal to display usage information.
